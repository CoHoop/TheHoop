Students study alone, at the library. It's boring and isolating. 

The Hoop is a peer-to-peer Q&A app for students to help each other out and schedule study sessions in real life.

Picture it... Laura needs help studying for her economics exam. She's struggling/procrastinating at Cafe Paris, on campus. Instead of heading to the library and googling things she didn't get,  she shares her questions on The Hoop and checks in where she is at. Other econ freaks help her out in a timely manner and can even join her IRL over a cup of coffee. 

The Hoop will be a native IOS Application, running along a Ruby On Rails Webservice.
